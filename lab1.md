**Step 1 Installing VS Code**

After installation, download [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) for windows and follow the instructions to install. Take care to not change any default settings.

Once both programs are installed open a new terminal in VS Code by clicking `...` in the top bar then `Terminal` or by holding `ctrl` and `'`. Next hold `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and type select default profile ![Image](default.png)
Select Git Bash then press `+` in the terminal you previously opened.

**Step 2 Remotely Connecting**

Before accessing the network, you need to find your account. Go to [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Type in your username and student id. Your course specific account will start with cs. Click the account name and then the change password tool. ![Image](password.png) Important: put your **course specific** username.
