## Part 2

## Part 3
I feel I have learned a lot in the last 2 labs. I did not know that I could create a server with the limited knowledge I have. I did struggle a bit to create the StringServer and have it work they way I wanted to. I still don't fully understand it, but I got it to run. I thought it was cool to use the remote server and be able to access other people's server.
